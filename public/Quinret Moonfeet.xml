               however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the
               people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

            <text>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon
               of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal
               world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers
               into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred
               rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
               Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with
               your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The Gods of the Multiverse
               section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a
               lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the
               sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your
               god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any
               established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master
               that you now deny.
               • Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion
               • Languages: Two of your choice
               • Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer
               book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a
               belt pouch containing 15 gp

            <name>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful</name>
            <text>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can
               perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions
               can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established
               presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for
               spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest
               lifestyle.
               You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or
               pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to
               serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new
               home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided
               the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your
               temple.

            <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
            <text>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities.
               Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to
               temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws
               might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an
               extreme.
               d8 | Personality Trait
               1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that
               person&#39;s deeds and example.
               2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and
               always working toward peace.
               3 | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need
               to listen.
               4 | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.
               5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.
               6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the
               worship of other gods.
               7 | I&#39;ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple&#39;s elite.
               Rough living grates on me.
               8 | I&#39;ve spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience
               dealing with people in the outside world.

               d6 | Ideal
               1 | Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and
               upheld. (Lawful)
               2 | Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost.
               (Good)
               3 | Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in
               the world. (Chaotic)
               4 | Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith&#39;s religious hierarchy.
               (Lawful)
               5 | Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work
               hard, things will go well. (Lawful)
               6 | Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god&#39;s favor by matching my
               actions against his or her teachings. (Any)

               d6 | Bond
               1 | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.
               2 | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a
               heretic.
               3 | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.
               4 | Everything I do is for the common people.
               5 | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.
               6 | I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to
               destroy.

               d6 | Flaw
               1 | I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.
               2 | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple&#39;s hierarchy.
               3 | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.
               4 | I am inflexible in my thinking.
               5 | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.
               6 | Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else
               in my life.

         <feat>
            <name>Spellcasting</name>
            <text>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the
               general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.
               Cantrips:
               At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You
               learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
               Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

               Preparing and Casting Spells:
               The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of
               1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the
               spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
               long rest.
               You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing
               from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to
               your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be
               of a level for which you have spell slots.
               For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level
               spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells
               of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
               wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
               doesn&#39;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
               You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a
               new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
               minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

               Spellcasting Ability:
               Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells
               comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell
               refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when
               setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack
               roll with one.

               Ritual Casting:
               You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have
               the spell prepared.

               Spellcasting Focus:
               You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

               domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides examples of gods
               associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you
               choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity
               when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and
               17th levels.

               Domain Spells:
               Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels
               noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it
               prepared, and it doesn&#39;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each
               day.
               If you have a domain spell that doesn&#39;t appear on the cleric spell list, the
               spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

            <text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your
               deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects:
               Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you
               additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.
               When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then
               finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
               Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from
               this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.
               Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and
               beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a
               short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

               light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are
               incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the

               • You grant it temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your cleric level.

               <text>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for
                  the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.
                  Cantrips:
                  At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list.
                  You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in
                  the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

                  Preparing and Casting Spells:
                  The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of
                  1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the
                  spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
                  long rest.
                  You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing
                  from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal
                  to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells
                  must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
                  For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two
                  2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can
                  include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
                  1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.
                  Casting the spell doesn&#39;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
                  You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing
                  a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least
                  1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

                  Spellcasting Ability:
                  Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your
                  spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a
                  cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom
                  modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when
                  making an attack roll with one.

                  Ritual Casting:
                  You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you
                  have the spell prepared.

                  Spellcasting Focus:
                  You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

                  when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel
                  Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th,
                  8th, and 17th levels.

                  Domain Spells:
                  Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric
                  levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always
                  have it prepared, and it doesn&#39;t count against the number of spells you can
                  prepare each day.
                  If you have a domain spell that doesn&#39;t appear on the cleric spell list, the
                  spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

               <text>Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods
                  of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to
                  friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath).
                  Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing
                  mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret
                  tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more
                  active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics
                  might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of
                  the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.

                  inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers.
                  Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and
                  Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the

                  necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride

                  Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the
                  undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave
                  off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to
                  accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death
                  will eventually get its due.

                  and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic
                  intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility
                  that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of
                  Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.
                  The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and
                  arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain
                  include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In
                  other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple
                  moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and
                  WeeJas of Greyhawk.
                  At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
                  They do not count towards your limit.

               <text>The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an
                  institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. On Ravnica, the domain
                  is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce
                  the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal

                  Forseti, and Asmodeus.
                  The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a
                  specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics
                  of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an
                  action&#39;s results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is
                  critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.
                  Law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed.
                  Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law
                  creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and

                  the expense of others is not shameful, but is proof of the initiate&#39;s

                  He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they will never

                  You can forge an empowering bond between allies. As an action, you can choose two
                  willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself)
                  and create a magical bond between them. While either bonded creature is within 30
                  feet of the other, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an
                  attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add
                  the d4 no more than once per turn. The bond lasts for 1 hour or until you use this
                  feature again.
                  You can use this feature once, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish
                  a long rest. You can also expend a spell slot to use the feature again.

                  city. While you are within any city, you can gain advantage on a single Charisma

               <name>Divine Domain: Order Domain (UA)</name>
               <text>The Order domain represents discipline, as well as service to a society or an
                  institution, whether that service is rendered in obedience to or enforcement of
                  the law—civil, religious, or both. Gods on many worlds grant access to this
                  domain, including Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Wee Jas, Aureon,
                  Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anubis, Forseti, and Asmodeus.
                  The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a
                  specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics
                  of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an
                  action&#39;s results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is
                  critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their deities.
                  More importantly, law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead
                  must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this
                  manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge
                  order and security in a chaotic multiverse.
                  At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.

                  against a target of your choice that you can see. If the spell targets more than
                  one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

               <name>Channel Divinity (1/rest)</name>
               <text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your
                  deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects:
                  Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you
                  additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.
                  When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must
                  then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
                  Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect
                  from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.
                  Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and
                  beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish
                  a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

                  As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can
                  restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any
                  creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This
                  feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You
                  can&#39;t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

                  banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.
                  As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30
                  feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of
                  you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal
                  to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a
                  successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

                  plants.
                  As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each
                  beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
                  saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1
                  minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you
                  and other creatures you designate.

               <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory
                  duplicate of yourself.
                  As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute,
                  or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
                  The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of
                  you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a
                  space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.
                  For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion&#39;s
                  space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your
                  illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have
                  advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the
                  illusion is to the target.

                  supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel
                  Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the
                  roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

                  When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel

                  items.
                  You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include
                  some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition,
                  a set of tools, or another metal object (see chapter 5, "Equipment," in the
                  Player&#39;s Handbook for examples of these items). The creation is completed at
                  the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface
                  within 5 feet of you.
                  The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part
                  of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value
                  equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the
                  creation at the ritual&#39;s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the
                  creation. The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains
                  metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

                  creatures.
                  As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or
                  fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving
                  throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its
                  saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
                  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
                  can, and it can&#39;t willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It
                  also can&#39;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or
                  try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there&#39;s nowhere
                  to move, then the creature can use the Dodge action.
                  After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your
                  Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the
                  banishment spell, no concentration required) if it isn&#39;t on its plane of

                  takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what
                  they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

                  takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what
                  they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

                  charmed by this ability, creatures consider all other creatures charmed by it to
                  be their allies. They fight to defend them from attackers.
                  While this ability persists, absent any threat creatures charmed by it will rest,
                  talk among themselves, share stories of their lives, create a communal feast using

                  duplicate of yourself.
                  As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute,
                  or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
                  The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of
                  you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a
                  space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.
                  For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion&#39;s
                  space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your
                  illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have
                  advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the
                  illusion is to the target.

               <text>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature&#39;s
                  thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature&#39;s mind to command it.
                  As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That
                  creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving
                  throw, you can&#39;t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.
                  If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost
                  in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking
                  about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.
                  During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the
                  suggestion spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target
                  automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.

                  You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score

                  Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object&#39;s
                  previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired
                  and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the
                  object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent
                  past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1
                  additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that
                  creature.
                  As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a
                  room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a
                  number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn
                  about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events
                  typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and
                  murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events
                  that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

            <text>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or
               employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity
               about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the
               next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
               • Weal, for good results
               • Woe, for bad results
               • Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
               • Nothing, for results that aren&#39;t especially good or bad
               The spell doesn&#39;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change
               the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a
               companion.
               If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there
               is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a
               random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

               If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
               You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this
               spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired
               in the meantime.
               Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that
               it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a
               spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the
               creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

               Atonement: You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed, and you make a
               DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its
               original alignment.
               Bless Water: You touch one vial of water and cause it to become Holy Water (flask).
               Coming of Age: You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours,
               whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number
               rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.
               Dedication: You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god&#39;s
               service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll
               a d4 and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite
               only once.
               Funeral Rite: You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can&#39;t
               become undead by any means short of a wish spell.
               Wedding: You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the
               next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each
               other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.

               language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.
               Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than
               one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the
               target can&#39;t follow your command, the spell ends.
               Approach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending
               its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
               Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
               Flee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
               Grovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn.
               Halt: The target doesn&#39;t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays
               aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the
               minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

               When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect
               one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within
               30 feet of each other when you target them.

               trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or
               unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically
               intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the
               alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a
               natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
               This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don&#39;t learn the location of
               each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you
               sense.

               one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within
               30 feet of each other when you target them.

               The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up
               close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest
               object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture,
               tool, or weapon.
               This spell can&#39;t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet,
               blocks a direct path between you and the object.

               centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
               When a creature enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts
               its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must
               make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or
               half as much damage on a successful one.
               A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also
               instantly reverts to its original form and can&#39;t assume a different form until it
               leaves the spell&#39;s light.
               On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the
               beam up to 60 feet in any direction.

               possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such
               a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant
               effect.

               (ignoring unconscious creatures).
               Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature
               affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes
               damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each
               creature&#39;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the
               next lowest hit points. A creature&#39;s hit points must be equal to or less than the
               remaining total for that creature to be affected.
               Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren&#39;t affected by this spell.

               With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a
               goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold
               piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not
               commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth
               hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the
               exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value,
               and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
               One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A
               silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a
               night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
               One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and
               beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
               In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure
               hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen
               empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when
               used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum
               piece is worth ten gold pieces.
               A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

            • Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action

            • When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you
            (and that target doesn&#39;t have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee
            weapon attack against the attacking creature.

         <text>A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet
            depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as
            an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or
            paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way,
            the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.
